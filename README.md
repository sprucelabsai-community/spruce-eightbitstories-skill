Hey there!! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tay!

This project started because I was really disappointed with the quality of children's books available for my daughters. So, I decided to try and prompt ChatGPT to write a bedtime story for them. It actually worked! Granted, it took a lot of prompting and editing, but it proved to be a lot of fun!

That's when I had the idea! What if I built a Skill on the [Spruce Development Platform[(https://developer.spruce.bot) that significantly simplified the process of generating our stories? And, what if I filmed the whole process of building it and shared it with the world?

Well, what are you waiting for? Let's get building!
